# OSTB Series 1 - the Spiros Series
This repository, part of Open Source Tuberculosis (OSTB) is about OSTB's first series of molecules. The data in this repository are being combined with closed data generated at GSK Tres Cantos and being written up for publication.

Social media updates will go on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/opensourcetb). OSTB can also be emailed: opensourcetb@gmail.com.

The story of where we are, and links to other online resources, is described in the wiki (link above).

In brief:

In 2012 GSK performed a phenotypic screen against _M. bovis BCG_ as a surrogate of the virulent strain of _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_ (H37Rv), ultimately discovering [177 small molecules](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cmdc.201200428/abstract) displaying <10 micromolar inhibitory concentration alongside favorable membrane permeability and alignment with the Rule of 5. One such series, the _Spiros_, were viewed as one of seven particularly promising sets of compounds. The GSK OpenLab Foundation funded a one-year collaborative project with Matthew Todd's lab at The University of Sydney, to develop the Spiros series (along with two other promising series) as part of an open source project. Open Source TB's first series is the Spiros series. The combination of preliminary work in Sydney (open source) with extensive pre-existing work in GSK (closed source) is being submitted as a research paper (July 2018).

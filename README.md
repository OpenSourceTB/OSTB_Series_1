# OSTB Series 1 - the Spiros Series
This repository, part of Open Source Tuberculosis (OSTB) is about OSTB's first series of molecules. The data in this repository are being combined with closed data generated at GSK Tres Cantos and was submitted for publication on October 2nd 2018.

Social media updates will go on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/opensourcetb). The best way to be in touch is to post an Issue (link above). OSTB can be emailed: opensourcetb@gmail.com but email is less good because it's secretive.

For more background to what OSTB is, head to the [General-Start-Here repository](https://github.com/OpenSourceTB/OSTB_General_Start_Here).


*Key resources*:

The story of where we are in Series 1, and links to other online resources, is described in the wiki (link above).

Resources to do with the series (files, reports etc) may be found on this page, above, in the shared file system.

Discussion takes place in the Issues (link above), which are closed when done. Feel free to post things there.

The spreadsheet of all Series 1 molecules may be found in the [OSTB Molecule Master List](http://tinyurl.com/OSTBCompounds)

In brief:

In 2012 GSK performed a phenotypic screen against _M. bovis BCG_ as a surrogate of the virulent strain of _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_ (H37Rv), ultimately discovering [177 small molecules](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cmdc.201200428/abstract) displaying <10 micromolar inhibitory concentration alongside favorable membrane permeability and alignment with the Rule of 5. One such series, the _Spiro_ series, was viewed as one of seven particularly promising sets of compounds. The GSK OpenLab Foundation funded a one-year collaborative project with Matthew Todd's lab at The University of Sydney, to develop the Spiro series (along with two other promising series) as part of an open source project. Open Source TB's first series is this Spiro series. The combination of preliminary work in Sydney (open source, using [an online lab notebook](https://tinyurl.com/OSTB-Jessica-Baiget)) with extensive pre-existing work in GSK (closed source) has been submitted as a research paper (Oct 2018) and a revision has been resubmitted (Nov 2018).
